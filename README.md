Moved to [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jbbandos/openmediavault-calibreweb)

This is a quick attempt at creating an openmediavault (https://github.com/openmediavault/openmediavault) calibre-web (https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) plugin, using podman and the image from linuxserver.io (https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-calibre-web)
The openmediavault-photoprism plugin was used as the base "template", with names replaced, and redundant/unneded functionalities removed
To build, it needs to be in the openmediavault tree.
